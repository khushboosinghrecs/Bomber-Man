# Bomber Man is a game in which a 9*9 grid of 81 boxes, 10 boxes contain bombs and other boxes are normal. If a normal box is clicked, the user is awarded a point

If a user clicks on a box containing a bomb, the game gets over (GAME OVER) and you need to give an option to the user to start a fresh game
